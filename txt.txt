Internship Duration: July 3, 2023, to September 1, 2023
Guided by: Suneel, Bhagwat Sharma
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, javascript (Some code has been taken from ChatGPT)
The website's codebase could have been more efficient if other technologies were used; however, it was decided that these technologies were the most appropriate for the project as per the developer's skillset.

* The website is mainly made for two purposes-
1. To present to stakeholders details about the delivered projects, team's expertise etc. [EXTERNAL USAGE]
2. To use it in team meetings instead of ppts showing team productivity, project history etc. [INTERNAL USAGE]

* This file serves the purpose of providing a better understanding of the file structure and code.

There are four folders viz.
1. Fonts -> Contains the file Siemens_Sans_Roman.ttf 
            This font is used in the whole website.
2. icons -> Contains all the icons (as well as logos) used in the website
            Most of them are in svg format
3. images -> Contains all the images used throughout the website
4. javascripts -> This folder contains all the JavaScript files. 
                    Each JavaScript file is dedicated to a specific component. 
                    Whenever a component is used on a webpage, the corresponding JavaScript file is imported to provide its functionality.
